# About Me

My name is Mike Wood. I'm an Assistant Professor at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) and in the Department of Computer Science at San Jos√© State University. At MLML, I am starting up the Computational Oceanography lab where we will use models and satellite data to understand our ocean and how it is responding to our changing climate. 

I am constantly learning, improving, and looking to share new code with anyone looking to collaborate on similar topics. If you have any recommendations for these resources, please feel free to submit a pull request. My repositories, created to support the classes I teach, are currently organized as follows:

## Jupyter Books
